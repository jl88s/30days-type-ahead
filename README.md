#30 Days of JavaScript - Type Ahead ###Friday June, 26, 2020 - 5:24 PM

This exercise sort of made me realize the power that JavaScript has in creating dynamic websites. There were a lot of methods, functions, and syntax mix-ups that were used in this tutorial and that had me confused at times, but I feel like over time it will come more natural. It confuses me when Wes creates a function component and adds a bunch of things within it. I guess I still don't understand what you can and what you can't add inside(locally) the functioning body and what steps has to go first in order for it to execute properly.
